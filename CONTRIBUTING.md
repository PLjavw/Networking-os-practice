# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## How to contribute
- File issues for bugs or lab improvements
- Open PRs with clear descriptions and minimal scope
- Use Markdown; keep instructions reproducible and OS-agnostic where possible
- Add safety notes if a step could be risky outside a lab
- Link to primary sources (man pages, vendor docs)

## Style
- Use fenced code blocks with prompt-free commands where possible
- Prefer native OS tools before third-party tools
- Keep labs under ~90 minutes; add "Stretch goals" separately

## Repo layout
- labs/: step-by-step exercises
- docs/cheatsheets/: quick references
- README.md: overview and index
- SECURITY.md: safety, reporting
- ROADMAP.md: planned labs

## Development
- Test commands on Linux (Ubuntu LTS) and Windows (latest) when relevant
- Screenshots welcome but optional
- Avoid hardcoding versions unless necessary
